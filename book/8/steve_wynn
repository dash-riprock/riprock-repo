Twisting joints like a contortionist
Laid in the Porsche
My father driving
Days been sunny since I started rhyming
No denying me. I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry
Nobody high as me
Green Timbs. In Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time, fellatio from three twins:
Those are triplets. I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed, and ate brisket, fuck!
On my behalf, he had a meeting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath from my lady friend
Mesothelioma money: Drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left, you know I'm still here
Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair
Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face
