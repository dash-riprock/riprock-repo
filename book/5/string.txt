Every three years, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) coordinates a global central bank survey designed to yield comprehensive and internationally consistent information on the size and structure of foreign exchange (FX) and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. By increasing market transparency, the survey aims to help monetary authorities and market participants better monitor patterns of activity and exposures in the global financial system.
