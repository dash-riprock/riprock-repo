I take quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks, 
Coca-Cola came and bought it 
For billions, what the f**k? 
Have a baby by me; baby 
Be a millionaire 
I write the check before the baby comes, 
Who the f**k cares 
Im stanky rich 
Ima die tryna spend this shit 
Southside's up in in this bitch 
Yeah i smell like the vault 
I used to sell dope 
I did play the block 
Now i play on boats 
In the south of France 
Baby, St. Tropez 
Get a tan? im already black 
Rich? I'm already that 
Gangsta, get a gat 
Hit a head in a hat 
Call that a riddle rap 
Shit, f**k the chitter chat 
I'm the baker, i bake the bread 
The barber, i cut ya head 
The marksman, i spray the lead
"I blood clot, chop ya leg" 
Do not f**k with the kid 
I get biz wit the cigg 
I come where you live 
Ya dead!
